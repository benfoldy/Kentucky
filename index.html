	<h2>Data at the County Level Helps Show Opioid Supply's Impact on Employment</h2>

	<p class="byline">

	</p>

	<p>
		For Eastern Kentucky, the great recession and the opioid epidemic were a one-two punch. Much of the state has recovered economically. But for many counties where opioids are abundant, the recession drags on. 
	</p>

	<p>
		Opioids killed around 50,000 people in the United States last year. The crisis levies immense costs on the health care system, the criminal justice system, and families across the country. But it also seems to be hurting the economy. 
	</p>

	<p>
		A <a href="https://www.brookings.edu/wp-content/uploads/2017/09/1_krueger.pdf" target="blank"> recent study by Princeton economist Alan Krueger published by the Brookings Institution</a> found that labor force participation fell more in counties where doctors prescribed more opioids.  
	</p>

	<p>
		Opioid prescriptions nationwide have declined since peaking in 2012, and Kentucky is no different. But for many Kentucky counties struggling to recover economically, opioid prescriptions still significantly exceed the national and state averages. 	
	</p>

	<p>
		With interactive maps made using county-level data on employment from the Bureau of Labor Statistics and opioid prescriptions from the Centers for Disease Control, you can see the correlation between opioid prescriptions and the sluggish recovery in some of the state's most economically depressed counties. In each map, you can click on a county to see its unemployment and opioid prescription rates. 
	</p>

	<p>
		During the recession's peak in 2009, the majority of the state had 	
		over 10% unemployment. 
	</p>

		Jobs were scarce, painkillers were not. In 2009, the average Kentucky county saw 130 opioid prescriptions filled for every 100 of its residents. In the state's coal-rich southeast, Bell, Floyd, Pike and Whitley Counties had a prescription per resident ratio of over three to one.

		In 2009, unemployment was severe statewide. Opioid prescriptions vary more by county. Here the maps are laid over one another. Swipe between them to see the patterns.

		By 2016, much of the state has recovered economically. Eastern Kentucky, however, still suffers from very high unemployment.

		This map overlay helps show that many of the areas that have had trouble recovering from the Great Recession are those with the highest prescription rates for opioid painkillers.

	<p>
		Researchers continue to tease out the complex interplay of social, economic and health factors to the opioid epidemic.
	</p>
	

	<p>
		In <a href="http://www.nber.org/papers/w23192" target="blank"> "Macroeconomic Conditions and Opioid Abuse"</a>, researchers from the University of Indiana and the University of Virginia found that an increase of one percentage point in the unemployment rate results in a 7 percent rise in opioid-related emergency room visits and a 3.4 percent increase in overdose deaths. 
	</p>
	
	<p>
		"Areas with high opioid prescriptions also tend to have continued to have high unemployment rates," said Christopher J. Ruhm, one of the study's authors, when presented with the data from Kentucky shown here via email.  	
	</p>

	<p>
		"It is possible that opioid addiction/abuse is hindering recovery in these locations," he continued. "But it is also possible that there are confounding factors that determine both. For instance, less educated individuals may receive more opioid prescriptions but also may be in places with weaker economic growth."
